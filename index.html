      <h1>Owen Schiller's CS Project Portfolio</h1>      
      <p>My name is Owen Schiller and I am a freshman at Santa Barbara High School. This is my first year in coding and I find it very interesting. I like to play sports and hangout with friends. Some of my interests are editing videos, filming, soccer, skiing, and surfing. I like computer science a lot because I think building websites and making your own projects is very fun. When I create something I know that I am the person responsible and its something I am proud of. I am very good at making videos and putting websites together. I make sure the design is perfect and everything is aligned.</p>

        <p><a href="https://replit.com/@OwenSC/Pacman-Background#script.js">Link to project</a></p>
        <p>In this project me and my partner worked together to make a pac-man game. I made the background which took a lot of work and it was difficult to make eveything perfect and aligned. I also made an array of dots so the pac-man could collect them and try to win the game. One problem we faced was making it so the pac-man could not go through walls. The teacher didn't know how to fix it but we will find a solution in the near future (hopefully).</p>

        <p>This was a project I did by myself and I'm proud of it. I made it so the trees come up from the bottom of the screen and I think it looks really cool. I also made the trees which are composed of three green triangles and one brown rectangle. I really enjoyed doing this project and it was a good skill to learn.</p>
